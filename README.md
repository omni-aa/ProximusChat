# React + TypeScript + Vite + Socket.io

This Project was build as a replacement for social media
it's soul purpose being is to be a haven and repository for all of my work
and development. both **Ethical** and **Unethical** practices.

In the future gaining access to this "Appication" will be done through myself 
using a custom Python tool to generate user accounts. granting the person permission

Again for access to the app users will have to contact me personally to access 
the community
